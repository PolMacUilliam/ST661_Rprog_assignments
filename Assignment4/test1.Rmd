```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse) # every time
```

## Question 1

```{r cars}
load("h4data")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
